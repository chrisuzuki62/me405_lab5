                           A brief description of the overall organization of the software.  Which files do what?
A discussion of the tasks and states in the software.  Of course, your task and state diagrams should be here, and
they must reflect the actual task and state structure of your software.  If your actual software has improved from the design you presented nearly a month ago,
the task and state diagrams must have changed as well.
Additional information about your software as appropriate.
